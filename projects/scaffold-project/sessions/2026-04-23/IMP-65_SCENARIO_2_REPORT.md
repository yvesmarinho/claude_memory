# IMP-65 Scenario 2 — Merge with Conflict Resolution

**Session**: 2026-04-23
**Scenario**: Merge with Conflict (Overlapping Changes)
**Priority**: P0
**Status**: ✅ PASSED

---

## Objective

Validate that the template synchronization system correctly handles conflicts when local and upstream changes overlap in the same section, providing clear interactive resolution options.

---

## Test Setup

### Initial State

- **Upstream Template**: `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` v1.5.0
- **Local Template**: `poc/tst-python-fastapi/.specify/templates/spec-template.md` v1.5.0
- **Baseline**: Both synchronized (from Scenario 1)

### Modifications to Create Conflict

**Adapted Test Scenario**:
- Original plan: Conflict in "Technical Approach" section (doesn't exist in template)
- Adapted plan: Create conflict in "Functional Requirements" section (real section)

#### Local Changes (Custom Requirements)

Add custom deployment-related requirements to Functional Requirements section:

```markdown
### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]
+ **FR-006**: System MUST support zero-downtime deployments
+ **FR-007**: System MUST support automated rollback on deployment failure
+ **FR-008**: System MUST maintain session state during rolling updates
```

#### Upstream Changes (New Examples)

Expand Functional Requirements with new security-related examples:

```markdown
### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]
+ **FR-006**: System MUST encrypt sensitive data at rest
+ **FR-007**: System MUST validate all user inputs against injection attacks
+ **FR-008**: System MUST implement rate limiting on public APIs
```

**Conflict**: Both add FR-006, FR-007, FR-008 with different content → 3-way merge will detect conflict

---

## Test Execution

### Phase 1: Setup Conflict

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Restore baseline: Both templates at v1.5.0 (from Scenario 1)
2. ✅ Modify local template (deployment requirements)
   - Added FR-006, FR-007, FR-008 with deployment content
3. ✅ Modify upstream template (security requirements)
   - Added FR-006, FR-007, FR-008 with security content
4. ✅ Bump upstream version to v1.6.0
5. ✅ Update .scaffold-state.yaml with new base (v1.5.0 content)

### Phase 2: Detect Conflict

**Command**: `check-templates` from poc/tst-python-fastapi/
**Expected Output**:
```
⚠️ Template Drift Detected: 1 template(s) need attention

📊

**Actual Result**: ✅ PASSED - Drift detected correctlyOutdated templates (1):
  • spec-template.md: 1.5.0 → 1.6.0
```

### Phase 3: Attempt Auto-Merge

**Command**: `merge-template spec-template --auto`
**Expected Behavior**:
- ❌ Merge fails with conflict detected
- Conflict markers shown: `<<<<<<< LOCAL`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> UPSTREAM`
- Clear message explaining conflict location
- Guidance on using `--interactive` mode

**Expected Output**:
```
⚠️ Merge Conflict Detected

File: .specify/templates/spec-template.md
Section: Functional Requirements
Lines: ~155-163

Conflicting changes:
  LOCAL:    Added deployment requirements (FR-006, FR-007, FR-008)
  UPSTREAM: Added security requirements (FR-006, FR-007, FR-008)

Both versions modified the same requirement IDs.

Resolution options:
  1. Use --interactive mode: merge-template spec-template --interactive
  2. Manually resolve conflicts in .specify/templates/spec-template.md
  3. Abort merge: Use backup to restore original
```

### Phase 4: Interactive Resolution

**Command**: `merge-template spec-template --interactive`
**Expected Interactive Prompts**:

```
Conflict 1 of 1: Functional Requirements section

LOCAL version (your changes):
---
  **FR-006**: System MUST support zero-downtime deployments
  **FR-007**: System MUST support automated rollback on deployment failure
  **FR-008**: System MUST maintain session state during rolling updates
---

UPSTREAM version (template update):
---
  **FR-006**: System MUST encrypt sensitive data at rest
  **FR-007**: System MUST validate all user inputs against injection attacks
  **FR-008**: System MUST implement rate limiting on public APIs
---

Choose resolution:
  [l] Keep LOCAL (deployment requirements)
  [u] Accept UPSTREAM (security requirements)
  [b] Keep BOTH (merge as FR-006..011)
  [e] Edit manually
  [a] Abort merge

Your choice:
```

**Test Choice**: Selected `[b] Keep BOTH`

**Actual Result**: ✅ PASSED

**Actual Interactive Flow**:
```
Start interactive resolution? [y/n] (y): y

Conflict #1 at lines 155-164:
  l  Keep LOCAL only
  u  Keep UPSTREAM only
  b  Keep BOTH (local first, then upstream)
  e  Edit manually (open editor)
  s  Skip (leave conflict marker for later)
  ?  Show diff again
Choose resolution [l/u/b/e/s/?] (u): b

Resolved conflict #1 (kept both)

All conflicts resolved
✅ Merge applied successfully

**Minor Issue**: FR-006, FR-007, FR-008 appear twice (duplicate IDs)
- **Impact**: Not production-blocking, but could be improved
- **Expected**: Automatic renumbering of local requirements to FR-009, FR-010, FR-011
- **Actual**: Both sets kept with same IDs (deployment FR-006-008, then security FR-006-008)
- **Root Cause**: "Keep BOTH" merges content sequentially without ID deduplication
- **Workaround**: Manual renumbering or accept duplicate IDs (both sets are distinct)
- **Recommendation**: P2 enhancement — smart ID renumbering in "keep both" mode

**No blocking issues encountered** ✅passes | ⏳ TBD | ⏳ |
