   - Recommendation: Simplify to Lite version
   - Decision gate: 2026-05-10 (or earlier if simplified)

2. **IMP-59 Uncommitted Work**: Review and commit changes to:
   - Design document edits
   - POC refinements
   - Then push commit `a018927` to origin

3. **Unpushed Commits**: Push 2 commits to origin:

## 🔍 Security Check

**Scan Status**: 🟢 CLEAN
- No credentials exposed outside `.secrets/`
- `.secrets/` properly listed in `.gitignore`
- All secret patterns found are in documentation files (expected)

## 🎯 Context for Today's Session

### Recently Completed Context
The last session (2026-04-05) completed major work on memory and search systems:
- Full-text search is now operational (`make session-search QUERY="..."`)
- Session docs have migration toolkit for legacy formats
- Memory assessment framework is ready for data collection
- Mini-Engram POC exists as design reference

### Active Issues
1. **IMP-58**: Data collection phase started, needs decision on scope
2. **IMP-59**: Design complete but unpushed, can be picked up if needed
3. **SpecKit evolution** (IMP-53 to IMP-56): Next major focus area

### Recommendations for Today
1. **Clean git state**: Commit IMP-59 edits, push 2 unpushed commits
2. **IMP-58 decision**: Assess if full evaluation needed or simplify to "Lite"
3. **Consider SpecKit work**: Ready to start IMP-53 or IMP-54 if memory work on hold
